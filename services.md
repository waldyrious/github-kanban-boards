Spent a couple minutes poking around at kanban-like alternatives/supplements to labeling:

* https://waffle.io/
* https://huboard.com/
* https://www.blossom.io/kanban-with-github

At a glance, Blossom looks interesting. (Marking issues from the command-line?) It's also pricey. The other two SaaS apps look solid.

* https://www.zenhub.io/

Chrome plugin. It's free, so could be worth an experiment.

* [Trello](https://trello.com/)

Free, easy to use. No direct GitHub integration -- would need to use IFTTT or Zapier, and might be suboptimal still.
